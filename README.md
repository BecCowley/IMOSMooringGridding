# IMOSMooringGridding
Code to collate IMOS Deep Water Mooring data into a gridded product.

The Gridded product produced by CSIRO and available at DOI: is created using Matlab code.

To start, a stacking process is run. Control is from each individual mooring deployment code under the folders 'matlab\_EAC\_depyyyy\_yy', where yyyy\_yy represents the years of each deployment. Each deployment has a .m file in the format 'mooring\_EACdddd.m' where 'dddd' represents the depth of the mooring deployment.

Settings such as file locations can be adjusted in each of the individual mooring deployment codes.
